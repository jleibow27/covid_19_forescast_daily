A Kaggle Competition:

In this challenge, you will be predicting the cumulative number of confirmed COVID19 cases in various locations across the world, as well as the number of resulting fatalities, for future dates.

We understand this is a serious situation, and in no way want to trivialize the human impact this crisis is causing by predicting fatalities. Our goal is to provide better methods for estimates that can assist medical and governmental institutions to prepare and adjust as pandemics unfold.
